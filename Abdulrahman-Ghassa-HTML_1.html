                    A <b>front-end developer</b> is a type of software developer who specializes in <q>creating and designing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX)</q> of websites and web applications. The primary responsibility of a <b>front-end developer</b> is to ensure that the visual and interactive aspects of <q>a website or application</q> are user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and functionally efficient.
                    <b>Front-end developers</b> work with various technologies, tools, and languages, including:
                    <em>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</em> The standard markup language used to create the structure and layout of web pages.
                    <em>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</em> A stylesheet language used to control the presentation, formatting, and appearance of web pages, such as colors, fonts, and layout.
                    <em>JavaScript:</em> A programming language that allows developers to add <u>interactivity</u>, <u>animations</u>, and <u>other dynamic elements</u> to websites and web applications.
                    <b>Front-end developers</b> may also use libraries and frameworks, such as <u>React</u>, <u>Angular</u>, or <u>Vue.js</u>, to streamline their work and create more sophisticated and interactive UIs. Additionally, they often collaborate with <b>back-end developers</b>, who are responsible for the <em>server-side logic</em> and data management, to ensure seamless integration between the front-end and back-end components of a web application or website.

                    <b>Back-end development</b> means working on <q>server-side software</q>, which focuses on everything you cannot see on a website. <b>Back-end developers</b> ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on <u>databases</u>, <u>back-end logic</u>, <u>application programming interface (APIs)</u>, <u>architecture</u>, and <u>servers</u>. They use code that helps browsers communicate with <q>databases</q>, <q>store</q>, <q>understand</q>, and <q>delete</q> <b>data</b>.
                    On a team, <b>back-end developers</b> collaborate with <b>front-end developers</b>, product managers, principal architects, and website testers to build the structure of a website or mobile app. <b>Back-end developers</b> must be familiar with many kinds of tools and frameworks, including languages such as <u>Python</u>, <u>Java</u>, and <u>Ruby</u>. They make sure the <em>back-end</em> performs quickly and responsively to <q>front-end</q> user requests.
